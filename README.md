# Amazon Bestseller Data Scraper

I've decided experimentally to open my own online store. To reach a wide audience and increase my store's effectiveness, I plan to align with current popular trends and offer the best-selling products at competitive prices. To achieve this, I aim to create a Python script that will daily scrape the top bestsellers from various categories, store this data, and generate a simple report. This report will help me identify the most popular products with the highest sales potential for the given period.

## What i gain from this project?

Firstly, I have learned web scraping techniques using popular Python libraries like BeautifulSoup and Selenium. I now understand how to navigate and extract data from HTML documents, and how to handle websites with dynamically rendered content using tools like Selenium. I have also gained experience in data cleaning and preparation by using Pandas and Numpys. I have learned how to connect Python with databases. Through libraries such as SQLAlchemy. I have mastered database management and SQL queries within Python. This includes creating and managing database schemas, inserting, updating, and querying data using SQL commands. Lastly, I have developed proficiency in Power BI, enabling me to create dynamic visualizations and reports. I can effectively filter data and use DAX to create new, valuable columns. This skill set allows me to present data insights clearly and interactively, making data more accessible and understandable.
