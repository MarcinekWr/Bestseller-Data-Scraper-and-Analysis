# Amazon Bestseller Data Scraper

I've decided experimentally to open my own online store. To reach a wide audience and increase my store's effectiveness, I plan to align with current popular trends and offer the best-selling products at competitive prices. To achieve this, I aim to create a Python script that will daily scrape the top bestsellers from various categories, store this data, and generate a simple report. This report will help me identify the most popular products with the highest sales potential for the given period.
